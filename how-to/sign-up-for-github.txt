So you want a GitHub account? Good on ya.

* Use your stuy.edu account to sign up.
* Pick a username you are comfortable with colleges and potential employers seeing, and that represents you and Stuy well.
* Set your display name to the name you go by.
* Let your password manager choose a long (>30chars) password and save your login/pass combo.
* Log out of github, log back in to test your password and password manager.
